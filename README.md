# 🌐 [My Portfolio](https://my-portfolio-opal-seven-68.vercel.app)

My personal portfolio website built with **Astro** to showcase who I am, what I build and how I think about code: fast, clean and with intention. It also features a **guest message board backed by a database**, so visitors can leave notes and feedback directly on the site.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Astro`
- `React`
- `JavaScript`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `MongoDb`

## 🚀 Features

- Clean, minimal portfolio layout with responsive grid design
- A message board where visitors can leave a note
- Astro-powered content and fast performance
- Shows personal projects, links, and social info
- Lightweight, easy to maintain and iterate on

## 📍 The Process

I built this portfolio to have a **living presence online**, something that represents both my code and personality. Astro was my tool of choice because it helps with performance and simplicity, especially for static content, while still allowing interactivity where needed.

One of the fun parts was connecting the message board to a database so people can leave comments. A subtle way for visitors (and recruiters 👀) to interact with the site. I kept the design clean and minimal so the focus stays on content and ease of use. I’m proud of how it turned out and I’m always making small improvements!
